# React Native Swiss Army Knife

Package where I keep my custom components, classes and other files that help me during the development of my React Native projects.

## 🧰 Toolbox

The Swiss Army Knife is currently divided in 2 directories:

### Components

* __CustomInput:__ an `InputField` with a few extra features set by default.
* __EmailInput:__ an `InputField` with e-mail parameters set by default.
* __PasswordInput:__ an `InputField` with password parameters set by default.

### Network

* __fetchers:__ list of fetchers (REST & GraphQL) that can be used with SWR.

## 🎨 Code Correctness

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep the code formatted and [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to follow best practices. The linting is done by running the command below in the project's root dir:

```
$ yarn lint --fix
```
